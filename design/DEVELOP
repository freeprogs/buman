This file describes this directory.


These files should contain equal UML diagrams:
  buman.xmi - writable UML diagram
  buman.svg - readable (by graphic viewers) UML diagram

To make buman.xmi the program Umbrello 2.21.3 was used. Since
buman.xmi is just an XML-file the graphic file buman.svg created from
the buman.xmi, using internal export feature in Umbrello 2.21.3. The
buman.svg may be viewed in any SVG-viewer.


The file uses ABNF with extension
  config-abnf.txt

You can find the language for grammars at rfc5234 and rfc7405.
